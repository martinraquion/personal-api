# personal-api (billboom top 100)
Created a 'billboom top 100'(billboard imitation) charts using musixmatch and itunes api
<br>
I made a Top 100 chart for different countries that can view track info with song lyrics and song preview

APIs used:<br>
Musixmatch API: https://developer.musixmatch.com/<br>
	-Used for fetching the chart, track info and lyrics<br><br>
iTunes Search API: https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/<br>
	-Used for fetching the album art and song preview since it's not available on the musixmatch api.<br><br>
REST Countries API: https://restcountries.eu/<br>
	-Used for fetching different countries and integrated it in the musixmatch api to view chart from the different countried
